            A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to
            part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. Symptoms include
            trouble speaking, understanding, walking, and paralysis or numbness
            in the face, arm, or leg.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Early treatment with medication like tPA can minimize brain damage,
            while other treatments aim to limit complications and prevent
            additional strokes.

                  affected. Additionally, mortality is higher and poststroke

                  glucose levels.
