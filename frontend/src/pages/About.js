            A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to
            part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. Symptoms include
            trouble speaking, understanding, walking, and paralysis or numbness
            in the face, arm, or leg.

            Early treatment with medication like tPA can minimize brain damage,

                  affected. Additionally, mortality is higher and poststroke
                  outcomes are poorer in patients with stroke with uncontrolled
                  glucose levels.
