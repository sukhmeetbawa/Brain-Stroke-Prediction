# Brain Stroke Prediction PWA

Welcome to the Brain Stroke Prediction Progressive Web Application (PWA) repository! This project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for predicting the likelihood of a brain stroke occurrence. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive dataset, our PWA analyzes key risk factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and medical history to generate accurate predictions. With an intuitive interface and real-time results, users can proactively assess their stroke risk and take appropriate preventive measures. Join us in this important endeavor to promote early detection and raise awareness about stroke prevention.
